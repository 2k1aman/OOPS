//encapsulation := refers to binding/grouping data members and methods into one single unit
// so that we can protect it from outside intervention
//it helps in maintaining privacy
//The general idea of this mechanism is simple. 
//For example, you have an attribute that is not visible from the outside of an object. 
//You bundle it with methods that provide read or write access. 
//Encapsulation allows you to hide specific information and control access to the objectâ€™s internal state.
//getter setter is used to get/set data members
